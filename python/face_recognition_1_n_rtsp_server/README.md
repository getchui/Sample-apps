# Trueface SDK Python Bindings Sample App
## Face Recognition RTSP Server
This sample app demonstrates how to consume an RTSP stream, decode the frames, run face recognition and annotates the frames, then re-encode those frames as x264 and stream the result over RTSP.

## Prerequisites
- Start by reading the `README.md` file [here](../README.md) for instructions on how to download the SDK and add the SDK to your environment.
Be sure to download the GPU enabled SDK for this sample app.
- `pip3 install opencv-python`
- `sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-doc gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio`
- `sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-rtsp`

## Project Overview
- `enroll_in_database.py` - This script demonstrates how to use the Trueface SDK to enroll face recognition templates into a collection. 
This script must be run before running the main application. Open and modify the script to use your own enrollment images and identities.
- `run_1_n_identification_rtsp_server.py` - This is the main application which consumes the RTSP stream, runs face recognition, then restreams the results. 
The application loads the collection previously generated by `enroll_in_database.py` and runs queries against that. The application also supports a dynamic variable frame rate, which allows us to run face recognition on all the detected faces in the image. 
- `run_1_n_identification_rtsp_server.sh` - Demonstrates how to run the python script with the required arguments. 

## Running the Demo
- Start by modifying `enroll_in_database.py` to enroll your own images into a collection. Next, run the script: `python3 enroll_in_database.py`. This will create a SQLite database file called `my_database.db`.
- Next, edit `run_1_n_identification_rtsp_server.sh` and change `--input_rtsp_stream` to your input RTSP URL.
- Next, run the main application by running `run_1_n_identification_rtsp_server.sh`. Wait until `Ready to accept connections...` is printed in your console, at which point you are ready to make a connection to the RTSP stream.
- Open up VLC, go to `Media > Open Network Stream...` then enter `rtsp://localhost:8554/trueface_stream`. At this point, you should be able to view the annotated RTSP stream. The stream tends to freeze initially, but give it some time and it should be working again.
